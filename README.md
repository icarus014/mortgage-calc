# React Mortgage Calculator

This project was created using ReactJS and Material UI

## What's this for 
This project was created to practice the use of UseStates Hooks, Functional Components in React, and handling props. 


### Sliders
The sliders function through the use of onChange and props. The lines of code for the slider use props destructuring, which allows for cleaner lines of code and ease of readability. 

### CSS Used
The CSS used for the front end of this web application was Material UI. I've found this and bootstrap to be useful for portfolio projects, as most companies use bootstrap for their websites and web applications.
